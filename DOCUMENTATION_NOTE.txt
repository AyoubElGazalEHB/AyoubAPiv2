This project includes the following key features:
- **JWT-based Authentication**: A middleware (`authMiddleware.js`) to protect specific routes.
- **Enhanced Validation**: Advanced validation rules are implemented in the `validateInput.js` middleware, ensuring date logic and phone number format are correct.
- **Modular Structure**: The project is organized into separate modules, improving maintainability.

**Next Steps:**
- Integrate the `authMiddleware.js` into the routes you want to protect.
- Apply the `validateInput.js` middleware to the relevant endpoints.
- Consider using Swagger for detailed API documentation.

Please ensure to replace 'your_jwt_secret_key' with your actual secret key used for signing JWT tokens.
